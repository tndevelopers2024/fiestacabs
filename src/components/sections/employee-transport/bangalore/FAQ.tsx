            question: "Please note, Fiesta's employee transportation services in Bangalore are B2B only.",
            answer: "Fiesta primarily provides corporate accounts for employee transportation services locally. We partner directly with businesses to ensure smooth commuting for their workforce rather than offering individual B2C rides."

            question: "How to arrange an employee transportation cab for an early morning shift?",

            id: "3",
            question: "How are outstation trips billed if required?",
            answer: "While primarily focused on intra-city commute, if corporate outstation trips are required, they are billed transparently based on per-kilometer rates and driver allowances as per the pre-agreed corporate contract."

            id: "4",
            question: "Can we customize a monthly contract based on employee count variations?",
